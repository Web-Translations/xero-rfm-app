# GoCardless Subscription Integration - Implementation Plan

## 📋 Current State Assessment

### ✅ What's Working
- **SDK Integration**: GoCardless Pro PHP SDK v7.2.0 properly installed
- **Service Architecture**: Clean GoCardlessService with dependency injection
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized config with environment variables
- **Database Schema**: User subscription fields properly migrated
- **Access Control**: Middleware for subscription-based feature access
- **Basic UI**: Membership plans display and free plan switching
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks with proper logging

### ❌ Critical Issues & Missing Components

#### 1. **Incomplete Payment Flow** (CRITICAL)
- **Current State**: Payment page is a placeholder
- **Missing**: Actual GoCardless checkout integration
- **Impact**: Users cannot subscribe to paid plans

#### 2. **Missing Customer Management** (CRITICAL)
- **Current State**: No customer creation in GoCardless
- **Missing**: Customer creation, bank account management
- **Impact**: Cannot create mandates for Direct Debit

#### 3. **Incorrect Webhook Verification** (HIGH)
- **Current State**: Using simple HMAC instead of GoCardless signature
- **Missing**: Proper webhook signature verification
- **Impact**: Security vulnerability, webhooks may not work

#### 4. **Incomplete Webhook Handling** (MEDIUM)
- **Current State**: Only logs payment events
- **Missing**: Payment failure handling, retry logic
- **Impact**: Poor user experience during payment issues

## 🎯 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Payment Flow (Priority: CRITICAL)

#### 1.1 Customer Management
```php
// Add to GoCardlessService
public function createCustomer(User $user, array $customerData)
{
    // Create customer in GoCardless
    // Link to user account
    // Handle customer bank account creation
}
```

#### 1.2 Mandate Creation Flow
```php
// Add to GoCardlessService
public function createMandateFlow(User $user, string $planId)
{
    // 1. Create customer if doesn't exist
    // 2. Create bank account
    // 3. Create mandate
    // 4. Redirect to GoCardless checkout
}
```

#### 1.3 GoCardless Checkout Integration
```php
// Add to MembershipsController
public function initiateCheckout(Request $request)
{
    // 1. Validate plan
    // 2. Create customer/mandate
    // 3. Generate checkout URL
    // 4. Redirect to GoCardless
}
```

### Phase 2: Webhook Security & Handling (Priority: HIGH)

#### 2.1 Fix Webhook Signature Verification
```php
// Replace current implementation with GoCardless's proper verification
use GoCardlessPro\Webhook;

public function handleWebhook($payload, $signature)
{
    $webhook = new Webhook($this->config['webhook_secret']);
    $events = $webhook->parse($payload, $signature);
    // Process events...
}
```

#### 2.2 Enhanced Webhook Event Handling
```php
// Add comprehensive event handling
protected function handlePaymentEvent($action, $paymentId)
{
    switch ($action) {
        case 'confirmed':
            // Handle successful payment
            break;
        case 'failed':
            // Handle failed payment
            // Send notification to user
            break;
        case 'charged_back':
            // Handle chargeback
            break;
    }
}
```

### Phase 3: User Experience & Error Handling (Priority: MEDIUM)

#### 3.1 Payment Failure Handling
```php
// Add retry logic and user notifications
public function handlePaymentFailure(User $user, $paymentId)
{
    // 1. Log failure
    // 2. Send email notification
    // 3. Update subscription status
    // 4. Provide retry options
}
```

#### 3.2 Subscription Management UI
```php
// Add subscription management features
- Payment method management
- Billing history
- Invoice downloads
- Subscription pause/resume
```

### Phase 4: Testing & Monitoring (Priority: MEDIUM)

#### 4.1 Test Coverage
```php
// Create comprehensive tests
- GoCardlessService unit tests
- Webhook handling tests
- Payment flow integration tests
- Error handling tests
```

#### 4.2 Monitoring & Logging
```php
// Add monitoring for critical events
- Payment success/failure rates
- Webhook processing errors
- Subscription lifecycle events
```

## 🔧 Required Environment Variables

# GoCardless Configuration
GOCARDLESS_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token_here
GOCARDLESS_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox  # or 'live'
GOCARDLESS_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_here
GOCARDLESS_CREDITOR_ID=your_creditor_id_here
